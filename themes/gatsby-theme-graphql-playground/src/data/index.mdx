# GraphQL Playground

This playground will walk you through a series of GraphQL queries, each designed to demonstrate a particular feature of GraphQL. You'll be querying the _real_ schema used on [graphql-reference example](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/graphql-reference) so feel free to experiment and poke around the innards of the site! You can also open the [Codesandbox version](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/graphql-reference) ([Direct link to GraphiQL](https://711808k40x.sse.codesandbox.io/___graphql)) of it.

You'll be using GraphiQL, an interactive editor you can also use [while building your Gatsby site](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).
