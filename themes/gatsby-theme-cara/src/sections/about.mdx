## About

> In this project, we learned about how to build an RFID based access control system using Arduino. The system will only give access on scanning the right tag and on scanning the wrong tag, the system will deny access and buzzer will make a beep sound. There will be a master tag that will be used to add/remove other tags.

The saved tags will remain even after powering off the module. The only way to reset the system is by using the wipe button that will erase all the data in the EEPROM. EEPROM has roughly 100, 000 limited Write cycle.
