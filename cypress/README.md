# Cypress

The Gatsby sites inside `examples` should be tested to ensure functionality of the `themes`. When adding a new theme/example in a PR also a test should be added.

## How to write tests

1. Add a file with the name of the example (from `name` in `package.json`) inside `e2e`
2. Write your tests. Ensure that every integral part of the theme is tested (it renders, it has its functionality)

- When possible also test the `themeOptions`

3. Add a job to the CircleCI config

```
e2e-test-NAME:
<<: *e2e-executor
steps:
  - e2e-test:
      example-name: NAME
```

4. Add the job to the workflow

```
- e2e-test-NAME:
  <<: *e2e-test-workflow
```
