In preparation for the upcoming [Gatsby 5 release](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/36609) this release will focus on some breaking changes unrelated to the `gatsby` core package. Another new major version will follow once Gatsby 5 is out so that you can upgrade in steps.

**Features:**

- Update [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) from v0.11 to v0.15 ([Theme UI Changelog](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md)) (**Breaking Change**)

**Breaking Changes:**

- Any breaking changes from `theme-ui` between v0.11 and v0.15
- Bump `react` & `react-dom` peerDependency to `>=18.0.0`

**Migration:**

- See [Theme UI's migration guide](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/blob/develop/MIGRATING.md)
