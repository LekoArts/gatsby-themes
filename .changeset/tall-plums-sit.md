Because this theme now uses a [Gatsby Head API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.5/#setting-html-and-body-attributes) feature that was introduced in [Gatsby 5.5](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.5/#setting-html-and-body-attributes) the `peerDependencies` range was updated from `^5.0.0` to `^5.5.0`.

Please also update your `gatsby` package when updating this theme.
