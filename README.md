## üé® Themes Overview

[![Themes Preview Banner](https://img.lekoarts.de/gatsby/thin_banner.jpg)](https://themes.lekoarts.de)

## üíº Contents

This repository is a collection of my Gatsby themes, managed as a [monorepo](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/monorepos/) with [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/).

- `.circleci`: Contains the configuration file for CircleCI
- `.github`: GitHub actions, templates for issues, and FUNDING file
- `cypress`: Contains the Cypress tests for `examples`
- `examples`: Contains the corresponding example sites for the `themes`. These projects can and should be used as a starter and will be copied over to their own repository. Hence they contain example data and additional Gatsby plugins (e.g. `gatsby-plugin-manifest` and `gatsby-plugin-offline`). The folder names are the contents after `gatsby-theme-*`
- `jest`: Primarily files for mocking functions/files in Jest tests
- `plop-templates`: Template for [plop.js](https://plopjs.com/)
- `scripts`: In order to run the tests on CircleCI some utility bash scripts are needed which are located here
- `themes`: Contains the themes themselves. They should only have the bare minimum of plugins installed (as `examples` can expand them) and also use `Theme UI` for styling. The naming of the folders must be `gatsby-theme-[name-with-dashes]` and the package name under the scope of `@lekoarts`
- `www`: Contains the source code for [themes.lekoarts.de](http://themes.lekoarts.de)

## ü§ù How to Contribute

Make sure that you have `yarn` installed on your machine (as it's mandatory for `yarn workspaces`). Fork this repository, clone it and run `yarn` in the root directory.

To launch the development server of an example site, use:

```sh
yarn workspace [examples/name] develop
```

In the case of `examples/emma` this command would be `yarn workspace emma develop`. Now you can make changes to the respective theme and see them via Hot-Reloading.

Commit your changes to a feature branch of your fork and open up a PR against this repository. The PR will have checks in place (unit and end-to-end tests) which you can also run on your machine in preparation for the PR.

Have a look at the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more.
