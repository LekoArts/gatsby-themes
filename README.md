## 💼 Contents

This repository is a collection of my Gatsby themes, managed as a [monorepo](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/monorepos/) with [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/).

- `examples`: Contains the corresponding example sites for the `themes`. These projects can and should be used as a starter and will be copied over to their own repository. Hence they contain example data and additional Gatsby plugins (e.g. `gatsby-plugin-manifest` and `gatsby-plugin-offline`). The folder names are the contents after `gatsby-theme-*`
- `themes`: Contains the themes themselves. They should only have the bare minimum of plugins installed (as `examples` can expand them) and also use `Theme UI` for styling. The naming of the folders must be `gatsby-theme-[name-with-dashes]` and the package name under the scope of `@lekoarts`
- `www`: Contains the source code for [themes.lekoarts.de](http://themes.lekoarts.de)

## 🤝 How to Contribute

Make sure that you have `yarn` installed on your machine (as it's mandatory for `yarn workspaces`). Fork this repository, clone it and run `yarn` in the root directory.

To launch the development server of an example site, use:

```sh
yarn workspace [examples/name] develop
```

In the case of `examples/emma` this command would be `yarn workspace emma develop`. Now you can make changes to the respective theme and see them via Hot-Reloading.

Commit your changes to a feature branch of your fork and open up a PR against this repository.
