Instantly create a styleguide page based on your Theme UI configuration. Zero-config — just install the theme and see your Theme UI config displayed in a beautiful manner. Using the Gatsby Theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-styleguide`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-styleguide).

[**Demo Website**](https://theme-ui-styleguide.netlify.com)

Also be sure to checkout other [Free & Open Source Gatsby Themes](https://themes.lekoarts.de)

## ✨ Features

- Automatic styleguide based on your Theme UI configuration
- Displays colors (individual and palettes), typography (font family, weights, sizes, headings), and a spacing scale
- Uses [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-specimens`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-specimens) under the hood. You can use components from it to extend your styleguide page

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this project

```sh
gatsby new project-name https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-styleguide
```

2. **Start developing.**

Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up.

```sh
cd project-name
gatsby develop
```

3. **Open the code and start customizing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

If you want to learn more about how you can use a Gatsby starter that is configured with a Gatsby theme, you can checkout this [shorter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/using-a-gatsby-theme/) or [longer](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/using-a-theme/) tutorial. The tutorials don't exactly apply to this starter however the concepts are the same.

## 📝 Using and modifying this starter

**Important Note:** Please read the guide [Shadowing in Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/) to understand how to customize the underlying theme!

This starter creates a new Gatsby site that installs and configures the theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-styleguide`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-styleguide).

Have a look at the theme's README and files to see what options are available and how you can shadow the various components. Generally speaking you will want to place your files into `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-styleguide/` to shadow/override files.

### Change your `static` folder

The `static` folder contains the icons, social media images and robots.txt. Don't forget to change these files, too!
