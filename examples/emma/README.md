## üöÄ Getting Started

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-emma) [![Edit gatsby-starter-portfolio-emma](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-emma/tree/master/)

1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this project

```sh
gatsby new project-name https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-emma
```

2. **Start developing.**

Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up.

```sh
cd project-name
gatsby develop
```

3. **Open the code and start customizing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

If you want to learn more about how you can use a Gatsby starter that is configured with a Gatsby theme, you can checkout this [shorter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/using-a-gatsby-theme/) or [longer](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/using-a-theme/) tutorial. The tutorials don't exactly apply to this starter however the concepts are the same.

## üìù Using and modifying this starter

**Important Note:** Please read the guide [Shadowing in Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/) to understand how to customize the underlying theme!

This starter creates a new Gatsby site that installs and configures the theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-emma`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-emma).

Have a look at the theme's README and files to see what options are available and how you can shadow the various components including Theme UI. Generally speaking you will want to place your files into `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-emma/` to shadow/override files. The Theme UI config can be configured by shadowing its files in `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/`.

### Adding content

#### Adding a new project

New projects will be shown on the index page of this theme and can be added by creating MDX files inside `content/projects`. General setup:

1. Create a new folder inside `content/projects`
1. Create a new `index.mdx` file, and add the frontmatter
1. Add an image to the created folder (from step 1)
1. Reference this image as your `cover` in the frontmatter
1. Write your content below the frontmatter

**Frontmatter reference:**

```md
---
client: "LekoArts"
title: "Theme"
cover: "./image.jpg"
date: "2019-06-10"
service: "Theme"
color: "#8e9d31"
---
```

#### Adding a new page

Additional pages will be shown in the navigation (left side) and allow you to display content other than projects, e.g. a "Contact" or "About Me" page. General setup:

1. Create a new folder inside `content/pages`
1. Create a new `index.mdx` file, and add the frontmatter
1. Add an image to the created folder (from step 1)
1. Reference this image as your `cover` in the frontmatter
1. Write your content below the frontmatter

**Frontmatter reference:**

```md
---
title: "Name"
slug: "/name"
cover: "./name.jpg"
---
```

### Change your `static` folder

The `static` folder contains the icons, social media images and robots.txt. Don't forget to change these files, too!

## üéì Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on Gatsby's website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

### Themes

- To learn more about Gatsby themes specifically, we recommend checking out the [theme docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/).

### General

- **For most developers, I recommend starting with the [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to Gatsby's documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Reference Guides_ and _Gatsby API_ sections in the sidebar.
