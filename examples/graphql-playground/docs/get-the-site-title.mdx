title: Get the Site Title
---

```graphql preview
{
  site {
    siteMetadata {
      title
      description
    }
  }
}
```

Start with the basics, pulling up the site `title` from your `gatsby-config.js`’s `siteMetadata`. Here the query is on the left and the results are on the right.

Try editing the query to include the `description` from `siteMetadata`. When typing in the query editor you can use `Ctrl + Space` to see autocomplete options and `Ctrl + Enter` to run the current query.
