```graphql preview
{
  allSitePlugin {
    totalCount
    edges {
      node {
        name
        version
        packageJson {
          description
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Gatsby structures its content as collections of `nodes`, which are connected to each other with `edges`. In this query you ask for the total count of plugins in this Gatsby site, along with specific information about each one.

Try using the editor's autocomplete (`Ctrl + Space`) to get extended details from the `packageJson` nodes.
