title: Limit

```graphql preview
{
  allMarkdownRemark(limit: 3) {
    totalCount
    edges {
      node {
        frontmatter {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

There are several ways to reduce the number of results from a query. Here `totalCount` tells you there's 8 results, but `limit` is used to show only the first three.
