```graphql preview

}

{
  site {
    ...fragmentName
  }
}
```

Fragments are a way to save frequently used queries for re-use. To create a fragment, define it in a query and export it as a named export from any file Gatsby is aware of. A fragment is available for use in any other GraphQL query, regardless of its location in the project. Fragments are globally defined in a Gatsby project, so names have to be unique.

The query below defines a fragment to get the site title, and then uses the fragment to access this information.
